# Initialization can be front-run in `CrossCurrencyVault`.

## Summary

`initialize` function in `CrossCurrencyVault` can be front-run.
 
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function initialize(
        string memory name_,
        uint16 borrowCurrencyId_,
        uint16 lendCurrencyId_
    ) external initializer {
        __INIT_VAULT(name_, borrowCurrencyId_);

        LEND_CURRENCY_ID = lendCurrencyId_;
        (/* */, Token memory underlyingToken) = NOTIONAL.getCurrency(lendCurrencyId_);

        LEND_ETH = underlyingToken.tokenType == TokenType.Ether;
        IERC20 tokenAddress = IERC20(underlyingToken.tokenAddress);
        LEND_UNDERLYING_TOKEN = tokenAddress;
        LEND_DECIMALS = TokenUtils.getDecimals(address(tokenAddress));
        BORROW_DECIMALS = TokenUtils.getDecimals(address(_underlyingToken()));
    }
```
`initialize` function lacks access control which means that anyone can call it. This function is used to set the important state variables that enable correct functionality of the protocol. User could front-run admin's / owner's transaction and initialize it with different parameters.

## Impact

Protocol functionality could be disrupted due to missing access control. User can front-run initialization of the smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `onlyNotionalOwner` modifer to `initialize` function to restrict addresses other than owner from calling this function.
