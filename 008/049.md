# `reinvestReward()` will not function as intended

## Summary
The protocol initializes by retrieving tokens only from `BALANCER_VAULT.getPoolTokens()`, without specifying a reward token during initialization. However, in the `reinvestReward()` function, the protocol attempts to exchange the reward token for pool tokens, and there is a check that the reward token must be one of the tokens specified during initialization. Since the reward token is not specified during initialization, this check fails, preventing the execution of reinvestReward.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `reinvestReward()` function is responsible for reinvesting rewards into the protocol.
```solidity
  function reinvestReward(
        SingleSidedRewardTradeParams[] calldata trades,
        uint256 minPoolClaim
    ) external whenNotLocked onlyRole(REWARD_REINVESTMENT_ROLE) returns (
        address rewardToken,
        uint256 amountSold,
        uint256 poolClaimAmount
    ) {
        // Will revert if spot prices are not in line with the oracle values
        _checkPriceAndCalculateValue();

        // Require one trade per token, if we do not want to buy any tokens at a
        // given index then the amount should be set to zero. This applies to pool
        // tokens like in the ComposableStablePool.
        require(trades.length == NUM_TOKENS());
        uint256[] memory amounts;
        (rewardToken, amountSold, amounts) = _executeRewardTrades(trades);

```
The issue lies in the `_isInvalidRewardToken()` check within the `_executeRewardTrades()` function. This check ensures that the `rewardToken` used in the reward trading process is a valid reward token, i.e., one of the tokens specified during the protocol initialization. 
```solidity

    function _isInvalidRewardToken(address token) internal override view returns (bool) {
        return (
            token == TOKEN_1 ||
            token == TOKEN_2 ||
            token == TOKEN_3 ||
            token == TOKEN_4 ||
            token == TOKEN_5 ||
            token == address(AURA_BOOSTER) ||
            token == address(AURA_REWARD_POOL) ||
            token == address(Deployments.WETH)
        );
    }


```
However, the rewardToken obtained during the reinvestReward function execution is not part of the initially specified reward tokens, the `_isInvalidRewardToken()` check will fail.

As a result, the protocol won't be able to execute the `reinvestReward()` function successfully because the reward token obtained from the trades is not considered valid

## Impact
The protocol won't be able to execute the `reinvestReward()` function successfully

## Recommendation

The recommended fix is to specify the reward token during initialization.
