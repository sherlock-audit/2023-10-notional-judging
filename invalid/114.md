# wrong logic when swaping  a  token

## Summary
wrong logic when trying to swap the token
## Vulnerability Detail
in tradingUtils line 158 it says that if the user  want  to receive weth but instead received ETH it will try first check if the new balance of buy is greater  than  the pre buy balance if it is it will try to subtract the subtract the pre buy balance from the the new balance and it will try to swap it into weth or eth but the thing  is that lets say a user want to swap eth into weth but as the comment say they might receive the buy token which is ETH so if they try to swap 10 ETH into WETH but received ETH but what they are going to receive will not be   greater than  the prebalance of eth it will be equal to 10 ETH which is the prebalcnce  so the if statement will not be excuted
