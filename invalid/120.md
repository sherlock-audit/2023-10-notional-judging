# Unlimited slippage during `emergencyExit()`

## Summary
In the emergencyExit() of singleSidedLPvault, the min amount out is set to complete zero, based on the assumption of proportional trades do not allow frontrunning however not all trades in pools will be proportional allowing for an unlimited slippage during emergency exits.

## Impact
This will lead to emergency exits returning up to zero amount out when unstaking and exiting a pool, leading to complete loss of funds during emergency exits
