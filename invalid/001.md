# Front-Running and Sandwich Attack Vulnerability in BalancerComposableAuraVault.sol and BalancerWeightedAuraVault.sol

## Summary

The absence of time-locks or equivalent mechanisms in the staking functions can expose vulnerabilities to front-running and sandwich attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

This vulnerability arises due to the lack of protective measures in the staking functions, allowing malicious actors to exploit transaction order and manipulate the state of the Balancer pool.

## Impact

Scenario:

1. **Victim's Transaction (Original Intent):**
   - The victim aims to stake LP tokens using the `_joinPoolAndStake` function.
   - The victim broadcasts the transaction to the network.

2. **Attacker Observes Victim's Transaction:**
   - The attacker monitors pending transactions and identifies the victim's transaction awaiting mining.

3. **Front-Run Attack:**
   - The attacker rapidly submits a transaction with a higher gas price, invoking the same `_joinPoolAndStake` function before the victim's transaction is mined.
   - The attacker's transaction is prioritized, leading to the staking of LP tokens in the Balancer pool.

4. **Victim's Transaction Mined:**
   - The victim's transaction is mined, but the Balancer pool now holds fewer available LP tokens due to the attacker's transaction.
   - The victim's LP tokens are staked, potentially impacting rewards due to the altered state of the pool.

5. **Sandwich Attack:**
   - With the LP tokens staked, the attacker swiftly submits another transaction to unstake LP tokens and exit the pool, aiming to exploit the changed state caused by their initial front-run transaction.
   - The attacker's second transaction, with a higher gas price, is swiftly mined.

6. **Profit for the Attacker:**
   - The attacker successfully unstakes LP tokens and exits the pool, potentially profiting from the changed state and taking advantage of the victim's transaction.

In this scenario, the attacker strategically employs transaction sequencing to front-run the victim, manipulate the Balancer pool's state, and execute a sandwich attack for potential financial gain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate such attacks, it is recommended to implement the following safeguards:

- Utilize time-locks or similar mechanisms to restrict the execution window for certain operations.
- Implement checks to verify that the caller is the intended user.
- Encourage users to set appropriate gas fees to minimize the likelihood of front-running.
