# `TradingModule.getOraclePrice()` return values not checked inside `CrossCurrencyVault.convertStrategyToUnderlying()` which may lead to calculation issues or division by 0

## Summary

Inside `CrossCurrencyVault.sol` when `TradingModule.getOraclePrice()` is being called, the return values `answer` and `decimals` are not validated. If any of these return values are zero, a division by 0 may happen which causes a revert, additionally a multiplication by 0 may happen as well. In such a scenario, this may prevent the protocol from continuing operating.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TradingModule.getOraclePrice()` is returning `answer` which may be zero, since `answer` is calculated as `(basePrice * quoteDecimals * RATE_DECIMALS) / (quotePrice * baseDecimals);`, which may be truncated down to 0, depending on `basePrice` and `quotePrice`. Also the return value `decimals` may be 0, depending on future changes of the protocol source code, where it is stated that decimals are currently hardcoded to 1e18 (line 236 TradingModule.sol).

If `TradingModule.getOraclePrice()` returns `answer` or `decimals` with a value of 0,  calculations that are depending on these values may revert due to division by 0.

This issue was previously fixed:
- Inside `SingleSidedLPVaultBase._getOraclePairPrice()` where two require statements were implemented (line 324-325 SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol) to address this issue.
- Inside `TradingModule.getLimitAmount()` line 290-291 where the require statements were adjusted from comparing `oraclePrice` and `oracleDecimals` with `> 0` instead of `>= 0` to disallow 0 values.

However this issue still exists inside `CrossCurrencyVault.sol`:

- `CrossCurrencyVault.convertStrategyToUnderlying()` is calling `TradingModule.getOraclePrice()` (line 131 CrossCurrencyVault.sol), but there are no require statements implemented to check the `rate` or `rateDecimals` return values not being 0. Then these values are used to calculate the return value (the value of the lent fCash in terms of the borrowed currency) as `(pvExternalUnderlying * borrowPrecision * rate) / (rateDecimals * lendPrecision)`. If `rateDecimals` is 0 then the calculation will revert due to division by 0, or the calculation returns 0 if `rate` is equal to 0.

A similar issue was reported in a previous audit [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional-judging/issues/2)

## Impact

Whenever the value of the lent fCash in terms of the borrowed currency is calculated inside `CrossCurrencyVault` via `CrossCurrencyVault.convertStrategyToUnderlying()`, the calculation may either revert (division by 0) or return a wrong value which is calculated to be 0.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing the same validations into `CrossCurrencyVault.convertStrategyToUnderlying()`  as in `SingleSidedLPVaultBase._getOraclePairPrice()`:

```solidity
// CrossCurrencyVault.convertStrategyToUnderlying()

131        (int256 rate, int256 rateDecimals) = TRADING_MODULE.getOraclePrice(
132            address(LEND_UNDERLYING_TOKEN), address(underlyingToken)
133        );
+134        require(rate > 0);
+135        require(rateDecimals > 0);
```
