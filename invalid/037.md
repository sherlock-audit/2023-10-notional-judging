# Unexpected behavior for UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter when msgValue is not zero

## Summary
Unexpected behavior for UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter when msgValue is not zero.
## Vulnerability Detail
 UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter are assuming msgValue is zero. But the caller logic is shared between BalancerV2Adapter and CurveAdapter which support positive msgValue. So, there is a chance that UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter will be given positive msgValue. Since they don't handled positive msgValue cases, it will return an unexpected behavior.
## Impact
If msgValue is not zero, UniV3Adapter, and ZeroExAdapter may execute unexpected behavior, also some trades will be impossible in Notional
