# Gas limit DoS via unbounded operations

## Summary

If a function requires more gas than the block gas limit to complete its execution, it will inevitably fail. These vulnerabilities typically occur in loops that iterate over dynamic data structures.

## Vulnerability Detail

Certain functions in contracts take arrays as input and iterate over them without checking their sizes. This oversight can lead to reaching the block gas limit and resulting in a reverted transaction.

## Impact

Functions vulnerable to gas limits can become uncallable, potentially locking funds or freezing the contract state.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To ensure that functions like these are bounded and prevent array exhaustion, include proper input validation mechanisms in your smart contract. Follow these general guidelines:

1. *Check Array Length:*
   - Before iterating over arrays, verify that the length of the array is within reasonable bounds to prevent exhaustion. Utilize the `require` statement for this purpose.

   ```solidity
   function executeDepositTrades(uint256[] memory amounts) external {
       require(amounts.length <= MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH, "Array length exceeds maximum");
       // rest of the function
   }
   ```

   Define `MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH` as a constant with an appropriate value.

2. *Limit Iteration:*
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over the array elements, ensuring that the loop index is incremented properly within the loop body. Avoid using unbounded loops relying on external conditions.

   ```solidity
   function executeRedemptionTrades(uint256[] memory exitBalances) external {
       require(exitBalances.length <= MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH, "Inner array length exceeds maximum");
       // rest of the loop body
   }
   ```

   Ensure that inner arrays are also bounded.

3. *Gas Limit Consideration:*
   - Recognize that large arrays or nested loops can consume a significant amount of gas, and there's a gas limit for each Ethereum block. If the array size or computation is too large, the function might fail to execute. Consider breaking down the task into smaller transactions if necessary.

Always tailor these validations to your specific use case and the constraints of your smart contract. Adjust the `MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH` and other parameters based on your system's requirements and limitations.
