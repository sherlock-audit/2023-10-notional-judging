# Use of transfer instead of call to send ETH.

## Summary
Although the use of transfer is intentional by the team, and used against reentrancy.
Use of transfer() might render ETH impossible to withdraw because after istanbul hardfork, there is an increase in the gas cost of the SLOAD operation and therefore breaks some existing smart contracts.Those contracts will break because their fallback functions used to consume less than 2300 gas, and they’ll now consume more, since 2300 the amount of gas a contract’s fallback function receives if it’s called via Solidity’s transfer() or send() methods. Any smart contract that uses transfer() or send() is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: 2300.

## Recommendation
Use call and and specified amount of gas to be used which can be change seasonally in a case of a fork
