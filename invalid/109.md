# If the lend token is eth, redeemfCash will most likely revert

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the scenario the lendtoken is eth, redeemfCash() calls wfCash.redeem() before checking if the lendtoken is eth and before the check to eth is done the function will revert it it doesnâ€™t have proportional vault shares in fcash.
## Impact

_redeemFromNotional() and _convertVaultSharesToPrimeMaturity() will revert on the call to _redeemfCash() in some scenarios when the lendtoken is eth

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check if the lendtoken is eth before the call to wfCash.redeem() and put in an if else statement.
