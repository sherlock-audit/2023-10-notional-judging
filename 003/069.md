# Hardcoding chainID might force redeployment in case of hardfork

## Summary
In case of a hard fork after contract deployment, the chainID in use becomes invalid and the contract will require redeployment.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `BaseStrategyVault` contract, the arbitrum chainID is hardcoded in the constructor. In case of a hardfork, the chain id changes, but due to its hardcoded nature, the declared chainID doesn't change which results in incorrect deploy and requires subsequent redeployment. 
## Impact
Redeployment which costs time and funds.

```L59
  constructor(NotionalProxy notional_, ITradingModule tradingModule_) initializer {
  // Make sure we are using the correct Deployments lib
  uint256 chainId = 42161;
```

## Recommendation
Replace with
```L59
uint256 chainId = block.chainId;
```
