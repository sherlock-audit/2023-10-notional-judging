# Lack of Access Control:

## Summary
Lack of Access Control: The setStrategyVaultSettings() and setStrategyVaultState() functions are internal, which means they can only be called by the contract itself or by contracts inheriting from it. However, the code snippet does not show any access control mechanisms (like onlyOwner modifiers) that restrict who can call these functions. Without proper access control, these functions could potentially be exposed to unauthorized use.

Lack of Access Control: 
## Impact
Without proper access control, these functions could potentially be exposed to unauthorized use.
## Code Snippet
 function getStrategyVaultState() internal view returns (StrategyVaultState memory) {
        // Hardcode to the zero slot
        return _state()[0];
    }

    /// @notice writes the strategy vault state to storage
    /// @param state vault state
    function setStrategyVaultState(StrategyVaultState memory state) internal {
        mapping(uint256 => StrategyVaultState) storage store = _state();
        // Hardcode to the zero slot
        store[0] = state;
    }
