# Users invest lpTokens but receives no vaultShares in return

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
Within the SingleSidedLPVaultBase._mintVaultShares function, it was observed that if the numerator is smaller than the denominator, the vaultShares will be zero.
```solidity
if (state.totalPoolClaim == 0) {
            // Vault Shares are in 8 decimal precision
            vaultShares = (lpTokens * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / POOL_PRECISION();
        } else {
            vaultShares = (lpTokens * state.totalVaultSharesGlobal) / state.totalPoolClaim;
        }
```
## Impact
When the vaultShares is zero, the function returns zero instead of reverting. Therefore, it is possible that users invest their lpTokens, but receives no vaultShares in return because the number of lpTokens input by the user is too small.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider reverting if the vaultShares received is zero. This check has been implemented in many well-known vault designs
```solidity
require(vaultShares > 0, "Failed to mint any vault shares");
```
