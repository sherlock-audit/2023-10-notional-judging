# If the pool used in `Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol` is killed `emergencyExit` would revert 100% of times, blocking this important functionality

## Summary
If the pool used in `Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol` gets killed, which happens regularly, `emergencyExit` would not be possible, which could hurt the protocol in case of an emergency.
## Vulnerability Detail
`emergencyExit` can be used by the emergency exit role to trigger an emergency exit on the vault, to protect the users and lock the vault, until the emergency passes, as can be seen here 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/common/SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol#L475-L479
this would call `_unstakeAndExitPool` with the `isSingleSided` bolean to true 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/common/SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol#L489
but for the case of `Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol` this could be a big problem if the pool used is killed. As you can see here, in the case where `isSingleSided` is true, it will try to redeem single-sided 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol#L80-L84
by calling `remove_liquidity_one_coin` on the curve pool. The problem arise that, if the pool is killed, `remove_liquidity_one_coin` would not be possible and revert 100%
https://etherscan.io/address/0xdcef968d416a41cdac0ed8702fac8128a64241a2#code#L709
 only `remove_liquidity` will function if a pool is killed, as can be seen here 
https://etherscan.io/address/0xdcef968d416a41cdac0ed8702fac8128a64241a2#code#L510
This would mean that emergency exits would fail, which could pose a real security threat for those cases, since in case of an emergency, the protocol can't use `emergencyExit`.
## Impact
Impact is a high one since `emergencyExit` could not be possible to be used in those cases.

## Recommendation
Take a different approach for emergency exits, so the protocol would have way of protecting itself, in case of emergencies for `Curve2TokenConvexVault.sol`.
