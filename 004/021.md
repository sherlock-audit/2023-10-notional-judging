# Risk of reward loss and incomplete exit handling in `emergencyExit()` function

## Summary
The `emergencyExit()` function currently lacks a mechanism to claim rewards during the exit process, potentially resulting in the loss of rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `SingleSidedLPVaultBase.emergencyExit()` function is designed for emergency situations, allowing the strategy to exit the pool and redeem a specified amount of pool assets.
The protocol currently executes `_unstakeAndExitPool()` in the `emergencyExit()` function, but it does not retrieve the rewards obtained during the exit. This design could pose a risk in situations where third-party protocols are compromised or during other emergency scenarios, potentially leading to the loss of rewards.
```solidity
 function emergencyExit(
        uint256 claimToExit, bytes calldata /* data */
    ) external override onlyRole(EMERGENCY_EXIT_ROLE) {
        StrategyVaultState memory state = VaultStorage.getStrategyVaultState();
        if (claimToExit == 0) claimToExit = state.totalPoolClaim;

        // By setting min amounts to zero, we will accept whatever tokens come from the pool
        // in a proportional exit. Front running will not have an effect since no trading will
        // occur during a proportional exit.
        _unstakeAndExitPool(claimToExit, new uint256[](NUM_TOKENS()), true);

        state.totalPoolClaim = state.totalPoolClaim - claimToExit;
        state.setStrategyVaultState();

        emit EmergencyExit(claimToExit);
        _lockVault();
    }

```

## Impact
Rewards may be at risk of loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform the operation of `claimRewardTokens()` and `reinvestReward()` internally within the `emergencyExit()` function
