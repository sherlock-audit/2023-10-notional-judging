# Loss of judgment on withdrawal asset length and slippage length leads to redemption failure

## Summary

Loss of judgment on withdrawal asset length and slippage length leads to redemption failure

## Vulnerability Detail

In the redemption of BalancerComposableAuraVault and BalancerWeightedAuraVault, the parameter transfer path for slippage judgment is:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    redeemFromNotional->>_redeemFromNotional: data
    _redeemFromNotional->>_unstakeAndExitPool: data.decode
    _unstakeAndExitPool->>_exitPoolExactBPTIn: minAmounts
    _exitPoolExactBPTIn->>BALANCER_VAULT: exitPool.amounts
```

In this process, it is never judged whether the length of minAmountsde is the same as the length of assets. In the BALANCER_VAULT [code](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8#code#F30#L118) and the [document](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/joins-and-exits/pool-exits.html#token-ordering), it is clearly required that the length of the slippage array needs to be the same as the length of the redeemed assets.


When depositing assets, there is a clear judgment. This may be due to the negligence of the developer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add 
```solidity
require(assets.length == amounts.length);
```
 judgment before requesting, and ensure the order is consistent
