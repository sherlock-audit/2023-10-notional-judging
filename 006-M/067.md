# Did not approve first to 0

## Summary
Amount to spend was not set to zero first before approval.
## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens, for example [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) and [KNC](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200#code) (18 decimals) have approval race protection mechanism and require the allowance to be 0.
Another issue is that there are tokens that do not follow the ERC20 standard (like USDT again) that do not return a bool on approve call. Those tokens are incompatible with the protocol because Solidity will check the return data size, which will be zero and will lead to a revert.
## Impact
Unsafe ERC20 approve that do not handle non-standard erc20 behavior. 
1. Some token contracts do not return any value. 
2. Some token contracts revert the transaction when the allowance is not zero.
