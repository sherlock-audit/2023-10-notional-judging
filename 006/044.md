# `getOraclePrice` in `SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol` does not check if the sequencer is down for Arbitrum/Optimism

## Summary
Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle, but this is not done in the `getOraclePrice` used in the `SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol` by calling `TRADING_MODULE` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see `_getOraclePairPrice`  calls , `getOraclePrice` on the `TRADING_MODULE` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/common/SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol#L323
which checks for the values that the chainlink oracle provides for those 2 assets passed as arguments, 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/trading/TradingModule.sol#L237-L261
but nowhere it is checked if the L2 sequencer is down, in the case of Arbitrum and Optimism, as recommended by Chainlink https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds.
This could lead to stale prices and wrong values, which would hurt the protocol.
## Impact
Medium, since the prices returned could be stale if the sequencer is down.

## Recommendation
Check if the sequencer is down for Arbitrum and Optimism, as per Chainlink recommendations.
