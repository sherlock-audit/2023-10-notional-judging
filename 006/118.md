# Absence sequencer status check in `_getOraclePairPrice`

## Summary

The `SingleSidedLPVaultBase::_getOraclePairPrice` function in the smart contract does not account for the potential downtime of the Arbitrum Sequencer when fetching prices from Chainlink oracles. Since this protocol is deployed to Arbitrum network a,d Optimism, not confirming the active status of the sequencer could lead to the use of stale or inaccurate price data.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function retrieves oracle prices without verifying the operational status of the Arbitrum Sequencer. This was confirmed from the deployed [TRADING_MODULE contract on arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2de2b1eecf5bab0add9147ebbb999395238d30a5#contracts) where it checks for the freshness of the data but not the status of the sequencer. In cases where the Sequencer is down or experiencing delays, the oracle data may become outdated or stale.

## Impact

Relying on potentially stale oracle data due to an inactive Arbitrum Sequencer can lead to incorrect price information being used in critical contract operations. This could result in erroneous calculations, mispriced trades ...

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a check to ensure the Sequencer is active before relying on the oracle data. This can be done by integrating Chainlink's L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds as in the [example](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code).
