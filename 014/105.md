# oracleSlippagePercentOrLimit for static trades is not checked, can be set to arbitrary value

## Summary

Trade might be settled with a large slippage causing a loss of assets as `oracleSlippagePercentOrLimit` limit is not bounded and can exceed the Constants.SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_PRECISION threshold for `_executeTradeWithStaticSlippage()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_executeDynamicSlippageTradeExactIn()` checks the whether the slippage percentage is valid,

```solidity
        require(params.oracleSlippagePercentOrLimit <= Constants.SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_PRECISION);

        Trade memory trade = Trade(
            params.tradeType,
            sellToken,
            buyToken,
            amount,
            0, // No absolute slippage limit is set here
            block.timestamp, // deadline
            params.exchangeData
        );
```

but `_executeTradeWithStaticSlippage()` does not check the oracleSlippagePercentOrLimit.

```solidity 

        Trade memory trade = Trade(
            params.tradeType,
            sellToken,
            buyToken,
            amount,
            params.oracleSlippagePercentOrLimit,
            block.timestamp, // deadline
            params.exchangeData
        );
```

This issue is similar to the 2023-02 audit, but at that time, the executeTrade function with dynamic and static slippage is combined. This time, it is separated, and the oracleSlippagePercentOrLimit for static slippage is not checked.

## Impact

Trade might be settled with a large slippage causing a loss of assets.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider restricting the slippage limit when a trade is executed without dynamic slippage.
