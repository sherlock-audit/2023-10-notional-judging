# setting deadline to block.timestamp can be very problematic  when trades are in the mempool.

## Summary
in StrategyUtils.sol during execution of dynamic and static trades it sets the deadline to  block.timestamp automatically, this is bad as setting to block.stamp allows a miner/bundler to hold a trade in the mempool and execute it at anytime of their wanting which can be used to cause grief traders due to their trades being executed at a time they do not want which can lead them to accrue losses. this can also be used to sandwich trades to make gain.
## Vulnerability Detail
you can see in StrategyUtils.sol  _executeDynamicSlippageTradeExactIn() and _executeTradeWithStaticSlippage() the deadlin for the trades are set to block.timestamp.
```solidity
   function _executeDynamicSlippageTradeExactIn(
..SNIP..

        Trade memory trade = Trade(
            params.tradeType,
            sellToken,
            buyToken,
            amount,
            0, // No absolute slippage limit is set here
            block.timestamp, // deadline
            params.exchangeData
        );
..SNIP..
    function _executeTradeWithStaticSlippage(
..SNIP..

        Trade memory trade = Trade(
            params.tradeType,
            sellToken,
            buyToken,
            amount,
            params.oracleSlippagePercentOrLimit,
            block.timestamp, // deadline
            params.exchangeData
        );
..SNIP..
```
## Impact
This allows trades to be vulnerable to MEV attacks and trades can settle in unfavourable times that will lead to loses to Traders.
