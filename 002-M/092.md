# Unchanged fixed chainId in the contract

## Summary
There are several chainId are fixed coded in the contract

## Vulnerability Detail
the contract need be redeployed when changing from Arbitrum one (chainId 42161) to Other network .
In the detail page
`On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
Arbitrum, Mainnet, Optimism
`

## Impact
the contract will not satisfy the requirement `require(Deployments.CHAIN_ID == chainId);`
so the contract cannot be deployed in Ethereum Mainnet and Optimism

```solidity
 uint256 chainId = 42161;
        //assembly { chainId := chainid() }
        require(Deployments.CHAIN_ID == chainId);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Visual Code

## Recommendation
take the chainId as a constructor param when deploying these contracts
