# Token Approval Error: Incompatibility with type(uint256).max

## Summary
Some tokens, like Uni, do not support `type(uint256).max` for unlimited approvals, leading to errors during approval.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `AuraStakingMixin._initialApproveTokens()` is designed to approve token transfers in bulk, ensuring that subsequent contract operations can be executed smoothly.
```solidity
    function _initialApproveTokens() internal override {
        (IERC20[] memory tokens, /* */) = TOKENS();
        for (uint256 i; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            tokens[i].checkApprove(address(Deployments.BALANCER_VAULT), type(uint256).max);
        }

        // Approve Aura to transfer pool tokens for staking
        POOL_TOKEN().checkApprove(address(AURA_BOOSTER), type(uint256).max);
    }

```

Some tokens, such as [Uni](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984#code), do not support the value `type(uint256).max` for unlimited approvals,they only accept `uint96(-1)`. This can lead to errors during the approval process when attempting to use the unsupported value.

## Impact
This could result in the protocol being unable to initialize approvals.
