# Some Token May Reverted on Large Approvals or Transfers

## Summary

Some ERC 20 tokens can revert if the approval or transfer exceeds `uint96`. This can trigger unexpected behavior during the initial approval of collateral tokens from the user until the stacking process.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `AuraStakingMixin.sol` contract there is an `approve` function that is called and the max value is `uint256` . This function aims to approve tokens as collateral from user to vault and from vault to stacking. Some tokens (e.g. `UNI`, `COMP`) revert if the value passed to `approve` or `transfer` is larger than `uint96`.  Below is the codebase for `UNI` & `COMP` tokens in the `approve` function section :

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint rawAmount) external returns (bool) {
        uint96 amount;
        if (rawAmount == uint(-1)) {
            amount = uint96(-1);
        } else {
            amount = safe96(rawAmount, "Comp::approve: amount exceeds 96 bits");
        }

        allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;

        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }

function transfer(address dst, uint rawAmount) external returns (bool) {
        uint96 amount = safe96(rawAmount, "Comp::transfer: amount exceeds 96 bits");
        _transferTokens(msg.sender, dst, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

Both of the tokens have special case logic in `approve` that sets `allowance` to `type(uint96).max` . While the number of approvals is max `uint256`, this may cause issues with systems that expect the value passed to `approve` to be reflected in the `allowances` mapping.

## Impact

Revert on Large Approvals or Transfers when execute the approve function that called on initialization

## Recommendation

Consider creating a special `approve` or `transfer` function that has a max `uint96` for both of tokens if the protocol still wants to receive these tokens as collateral.
