# Multiplication on the result of a division that can cause precision loss

## Summary

The function `SingleSidedLPVaultBase._calculateLPTokenValue(uint256[],uint256[])` in the file `SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol` is a function that performs a multiplication on the result of a division. This violates the best practices for writing secure smart contracts and introduces a potential vulnerability.
## Vulnerability Detail

A function that performs arithmetic operations on integers should be careful about the order of the operations and the possibility of overflow or underflow. Solidityâ€™s integer division truncates the fractional part of the result, which means that performing division before multiplication can lead to precision loss. However, the function `SingleSidedLPVaultBase._calculateLPTokenValue(uint256[],uint256[])` does not take this into account. Instead, it performs two multiplications on the result of a division, which could result in inaccurate or incorrect calculations. This is a dangerous and risky behavior, as it could affect the value of the LP tokens and the balance of the vault.
## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability depends on how the function `SingleSidedLPVaultBase._calculateLPTokenValue(uint256[],uint256[])` is used and what the input parameters represent. If the function is used to calculate the value of the LP tokens in the primary token, then it could lead to inaccurate or incorrect valuation. For example, if the function performs a division that truncates a significant fraction of the result, then the subsequent multiplications could amplify the error and cause the function to return a lower or higher value than the actual value. This could result in loss of funds, unauthorized transfers, or incorrect fee calculations.

        if (address(tokens[i]) == address(POOL_TOKEN())) continue;
        // This is the claim on the pool balance of 1 LP token.
        // Performs a division before multiplication
@>>   uint256 tokenClaim = balances[i] * POOL_PRECISION() / totalSupply;
        if (i == PRIMARY_INDEX()) {
            oneLPValueInPrimary += tokenClaim;
        } else {
            uint256 price = _getOraclePairPrice(primaryToken, address(tokens[i]));

            // Check that the spot price and the oracle price are near each other. If this is
            // not true then we assume that the LP pool is being manipulated.
            uint256 lowerLimit = price * (Constants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS - limit) / Constants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS;
            uint256 upperLimit = price * (Constants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS + limit) / Constants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS;
            if (spotPrices[i] < lowerLimit || upperLimit < spotPrices[i]) {
                revert Errors.InvalidPrice(price, spotPrices[i]);
            }

            // Convert the token claim to primary using the oracle pair price.
            uint256 secondaryDecimals = 10 ** decimals[i];
            // Performs another multiplication on the result of a division
   @>>     oneLPValueInPrimary += (tokenClaim * POOL_PRECISION() * primaryDecimals) / 
                (price * secondaryDecimals);
        }
    }

## Recommendation

The recommendation to fix this vulnerability is to consider ordering multiplication before division. This can reduce the precision loss and improve the accuracy of the calculations. 
```solidity

    uint256[] memory balances,
    uint256[] memory spotPrices

    address primaryToken = address(tokens[PRIMARY_INDEX()]);
    uint256 primaryDecimals = 10 ** decimals[PRIMARY_INDEX()];
    uint256 totalSupply = _totalPoolSupply();
    uint256 limit = VaultStorage.getStrategyVaultSettings().oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent;

    for (uint256 i; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        // Skip the pool token if it is in the token list (i.e. ComposablePools)
        if (address(tokens[i]) == address(POOL_TOKEN())) continue;
        // This is the claim on the pool balance of 1 LP token.
        // Performs a multiplication before division
        uint256 tokenClaim = (balances[i] * POOL_PRECISION()) / totalSupply;
        if (i == PRIMARY_INDEX()) {
            oneLPValueInPrimary += tokenClaim;
        } else {
            uint256 price = _getOraclePairPrice(primaryToken, address(tokens[i]));

            // Check that the spot price and the oracle price are near each other. If this is
            // not true then we assume that the LP pool is being manipulated.
            uint256 lowerLimit = (price * (Constants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS - limit)) / Constants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS;
            uint256 upperLimit = (price * (Constants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS + limit)) / Constants.VAULT_PERCENT_BASIS;
            if (spotPrices[i] < lowerLimit || upperLimit < spotPrices[i]) {
                revert Errors.InvalidPrice(price, spotPrices[i]);
            }

            // Convert the token claim to primary using the oracle pair price.
            uint256 secondaryDecimals = 10 ** decimals[i];
            // Performs another multiplication before division
            oneLPValueInPrimary += ((tokenClaim * POOL_PRECISION() * primaryDecimals) / 
                price) / secondaryDecimals;
        }
    }
