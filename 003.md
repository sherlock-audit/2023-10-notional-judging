# No Protection of Uninitialized Implementation Contracts From Attacker

## Summary
The inclusion of the `_disableInitializers` function in the abstract contract serves as a proactive security measure, providing a foundation for controlled initialization behavior in the contract's inheritance hierarchy. Although the function may not be currently employed, its presence establishes a robust design pattern, preparing the contract for potential future scenarios where preventing further initialization becomes essential.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability mitigated by using `_disableInitializers` relates to the possibility of an attacker exploiting reinitialization, potentially compromising the contract's intended behavior. However **all contracts** which implements `AccessControlUpgradeable` & `Initializable` do not call _disableInitializers in the constructors Without the proper use of `_disableInitializers`, the contract might be susceptible to unexpected reinitialization, leading to unanticipated consequences and potential security risks.
To further prove my point in the `contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol` it states the following:
```solidity
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

## Impact
Failure to use `_disableInitializers` could allow an attacker to exploit the contract's initialization process, leading to unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, or even a complete compromise of the contract's functionality. This vulnerability could impact the security and reliability of the contract, potentially putting user funds or sensitive operations at risk.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For contracts that inherit BaseStrategyVault, do include the following
```solidity 
abstract contract BaseStrategyVault is Initializable, IStrategyVault, AccessCont
     /// @notice Set the NOTIONAL address on deployment
     constructor(NotionalProxy notional_, ITradingModule tradingModule_) initializer {
         // Make sure we are using the correct Deployments lib
+        //@audit-issue Prevent further re-initialization of the implementation contract
+        _disableInitializers();
         uint256 chainId = 42161;
         //assembly { chainId := chainid() }
         require(Deployments.CHAIN_ID == chainId);
```
For contracts that do not inherit `BaseStrategyVault` do include `_disableInitializers()` in constructor
