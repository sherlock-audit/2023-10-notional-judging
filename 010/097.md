# Lack of Approve To Zero First

## Summary

Lack of Approve To Zero First, allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail

Compared to previous version of CrossCurrencyVault (fCash), the approval of lending token was on constructor and set it to max, but now the approval is per deposit.

This issue is a common issue of approving zero amount first which should not be overlooked. Few tokens require the approval limit to be 0 before setting a new approval limit like USDT.

As seen below, on line 197, the lendToken, which potentially be a USDT, is lack of approve 0 before changing to the target approve amount.

```js
File: CrossCurrencyVault.sol
161:     function _depositFromNotional(
162:         address /* account */,
163:         uint256 depositUnderlyingExternal,
164:         uint256 maturity,
165:         bytes calldata data
166:     ) internal override returns (uint256 vaultShares) {
167:         if (depositUnderlyingExternal == 0) return 0;
168: 
169:         IERC20 lendToken = LEND_UNDERLYING_TOKEN;
...
187:         if (maturity == Constants.PRIME_CASH_VAULT_MATURITY) {
188:             // Lend variable
189:             vaultShares = _depositToPrimeCash(isETH, lendUnderlyingTokens);
190:         } else {
191:             // Lending fixed, the fCash wrapper uses WETH instead of ETH.
192:             IWrappedfCash wfCash = getWrappedFCashAddress(maturity);
193:             if (isETH) {
...
196:             } else {
197:  @>             lendToken.approve(address(wfCash), lendUnderlyingTokens);
198:             }
199:             vaultShares = wfCash.deposit(lendUnderlyingTokens, address(this));
200:         }
201: 
202:         // Slippage check against lending
203:         require(params.minVaultShares <= vaultShares, "Slippage: Vault Shares");
204:     }
...
285:     /// @notice Deposits some balance of tokens onto Notional to be lent as prime cash.
286:     function _depositToPrimeCash(bool isETH, uint256 lendUnderlyingTokens) private returns (uint256) {
287:         // Lending variable
288:  @>     if (!isETH) LEND_UNDERLYING_TOKEN.approve(address(NOTIONAL), lendUnderlyingTokens);
...
294:     }
```

This issue type was exist on previous notional audit and it was confirmed, but now it's occure again in latest code.

## Impact

CrossCurrency vaults will not work, especially when deposit and lendToken is like USDT token

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance.
