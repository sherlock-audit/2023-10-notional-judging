# Potential Stranded Rewards in Aura Pool for Newly Added Tokens

## Summary
The introduction of new rewards to the Aura pool may result in the tokens becoming stranded within the protocol, rendering them inaccessible for withdrawal.
## Vulnerability Detail
If a new reward token is added to the [Aura pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb6b1c1a1ea5618b3cfc20f81a11a97e930fa46b#code), calling `getReward()` will introduce the new reward token into the protocol. However, when the `REWARD_REINVESTMENT_ROLE` executes `reinvestReward()`, there is a check in `_isInvalidRewardToken()` that verifies the token against the ones specified during initialization. 
```solidity
function _isInvalidRewardToken(address token) internal override view returns (bool) {
        return (
            token == TOKEN_1 ||
            token == TOKEN_2 ||
            token == TOKEN_3 ||
            token == TOKEN_4 ||
            token == TOKEN_5 ||
            token == address(AURA_BOOSTER) ||
            token == address(AURA_REWARD_POOL) ||
            token == address(Deployments.WETH)
        );
    }

```

Since the newly added reward token is not part of the initial specification, the validation fails. As a result, the token cannot be exchanged for pool tokens and cannot be withdrawn, remaining indefinitely within the protocol.
