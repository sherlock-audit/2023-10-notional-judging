# `_mintVaultShares()` in `SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol` can revert unexpectedly, causing DOS to deposits from notional.

## Summary
the call to `_mintVaultShares()`  can revert for a certain vault share greater than type(uint80).max on the call to `.toUint80` due to overflow.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `SingleSidedLPVaultBase` contract during the execution of `_depositFromNotional()` function calls the internal function [`_mintVaultShares()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/common/SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol#L229C1-L240C64).
Inside this function could be seen casting uint256 typed local variables to uint80 type:

```solidity
    function _mintVaultShares(uint256 lpTokens) internal returns (uint256 vaultShares) {
        StrategyVaultState memory state = VaultStorage.getStrategyVaultState();
        if (state.totalPoolClaim == 0) {
            // Vault Shares are in 8 decimal precision
            //@audit the percison used to divide is above the normal percios and would lead to low amounts
            vaultShares = (lpTokens * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / POOL_PRECISION();
        } else {
            vaultShares = (lpTokens * state.totalVaultSharesGlobal) / state.totalPoolClaim; //@audit in a situation we have a low enough ppoltoclaim the vault shares can go above uint80.
        }

        // Updates internal storage here
        state.totalPoolClaim += lpTokens;
        state.totalVaultSharesGlobal += vaultShares.toUint80();
        state.setStrategyVaultState();
..SNIP..
```
This casting could be considered safe only based on the assumption that value of `vaultShares` returned would always be less than uint80.maxValue.
However, we could see that this assumption would be wrong in case of low enough `totalPoolClaim ` amount in the pool.
```solidity
        if (state.totalPoolClaim == 0) {
            // Vault Shares are in 8 decimal precision
            //@audit the percison used to divide is above the normal percios and would lead to low amounts
            vaultShares = (lpTokens * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / POOL_PRECISION();
        } else {
            vaultShares = (lpTokens * state.totalVaultSharesGlobal) / state.totalPoolClaim; //@audit in a situation we have a low enough ppoltoclaim the vault shares can go above uint80.
        }
```
With a small `state.totalPoolClaim` where `state.totalPoolClaim != 0`  , big  `lpTokens` and  `state.totalVaultSharesGlobal` values, the calculation could result in a `vaultShares` that is greater than `uint80.maxValue.`
This will lead to an overflow on the line   `state.totalVaultSharesGlobal += vaultShares.toUint80();` causing a revert, resulting to DOS on the call to deposit from notional.

## Impact
This would brick deposits from notional on the call to  [`_depositFromNotional()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/common/SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol#L195C1-L223C43)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing the `state.totalVaultSharesGlobal `field type from uint80 to uint256.
