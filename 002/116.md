# Using `block.timestamp` for swap deadline offers no protection

## Summary

Using the `block.timestamp` is dangerous as it offers no protection at all.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `CrossCurrencyVaul:_depositFromNotional` method, `block.timestamp` is passed as the `deadline` parameter.  In such a scenario, a malicious validator can hold back the transaction and execute it at a more favourable block number.

## Impact

Such delay can result in loss of funds for users and completing the trade at much more unfavourable conditions for them.

```solidity
        Trade memory trade = Trade({
            tradeType: TradeType.EXACT_IN_SINGLE,
            sellToken: address(_underlyingToken()),
            buyToken: address(lendToken),
            amount: depositUnderlyingExternal,
            limit: params.minPurchaseAmount,
            deadline: block.timestamp, //@audit infinite deadline
            exchangeData: params.exchangeData
        });
```

## Recommendation

Consider passing `_deadline` as an input parameter so an appropriate check is in place that the trade will be completed in a specific timeframe.
