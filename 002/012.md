# `block.timestamp` offers no protection as a deadline for a swap

## Summary

`block.timestamp` will have the value of whichever block the txn is inserted into, hence the txn can be held indefinitely by malicious validators.

## Vulnerability Detail

Block proposers have advance knowledge of whether they will be suggesting individual blocks or a sequence of blocks ahead of time. In this situation, a dishonest validator could delay a transaction and carry it out at a more advantageous block number.

## Impact

Transaction can be validated at further blocks on less favorable terms.
