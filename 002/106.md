# No expiration deadline for trades can lead to loss of funds

## Summary
The `StrategyUtils::_executeTradeWithStaticSlippage()` and `StrategyUtils::_executeDynamicSlippageTradeExactIn()` do not set an expiration deadline, which can result in loss of funds when swapping tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The deadline parameter in the `StrategyUtils::_executeTradeWithStaticSlippage()` and `StrategyUtils::_executeDynamicSlippageTradeExactIn()`  is set to block.timestamp. That means the functions will accept a token Trade/swap at any block number (i.e., no expiration deadline). These function are called from `StrategyUtils::executeRedemptionTrades()` and `StrategyUtils::executeRewardTrades()`.

## Impact

Without an expiration deadline, a malicious miner/validator can hold a transaction until they favor it or they can make a profit. As a result, the caller of the functions `StrategyUtils::executeRedemptionTrades()` and `StrategyUtils::executeRewardTrades()` can lose a lot of funds from slippage. Other functions like `_redeemFromNotional` and `_depositFromNotional` have this issue.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Considere setting the deadline parameter with a proper timestamp in the functions `StrategyUtils::executeRedemptionTrades()` and `StrategyUtils::executeRewardTrades()`. Same for `depositFromNotional` and `redeemFromNotional`.
