# Can't use block.timestamp as deadline since it can be manipulated

## Summary
Normally in trading, users will specify a deadline parameter that enforces a time limit by which the transaction must be executed. Without a deadline parameter, the transaction may sit in the mempool and be executed at a much later time potentially resulting in a worse price for the user. ProtocolsÂ shouldn't set the deadline to block.timestamp as a validator can hold the transaction and the block it is eventually put into will be block.timestamp, so this offers no protection.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 Trade memory trade = Trade(
            params.tradeType,
            sellToken,
            buyToken,
            amount,
            0, // No absolute slippage limit is set here
            block.timestamp, // deadline       
            params.exchangeData
        );
```
In Trade, block.timestamp is passed as deadline for this transaction, may result in a worse price for the user

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Protocols should allow users to set expiration deadlines by themselves
