# Checking for an invalid reward token could potentially lead to a executeRewardTrades DOS

## Summary
Checking for an invalid reward token could potentially lead to a executeRewardTrades DOS.

## Vulnerability Detail
Bot can claim reward tokens from reward pool and then reinvest them as LP  tokens which are donated to all vault users。This requires the following 2-step process ：
* 1.claimRewardTokens
* 2.reinvestReward

There exist a [_isInvalidRewardToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/balancer/mixins/AuraStakingMixin.sol#L38#L49) to ensure reward token is not in list of pool tokens 
```solidity
    function _isInvalidRewardToken(address token) internal override view returns (bool) {
        return (
            token == TOKEN_1 ||
            token == TOKEN_2 ||
            token == TOKEN_3 ||
            token == TOKEN_4 ||
            token == TOKEN_5 ||
            token == address(AURA_BOOSTER) ||
            token == address(AURA_REWARD_POOL) ||
            token == address(Deployments.WETH)
        );
    }
```
The reward token present is the `BAL` token, which is claimed from the ARUA reward pool 。 However it is possible  that the `BAL` token is inside the pool .

Here is a list of pools from `AURA`:
![alt bal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coffiasd/images/main/BAL.png)

And I believe there is a possibility of adding more pools in the future that include `BAL`。If this type of pool encounters a revert during the [reinvestReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/common/SingleSidedLPVaultBase.sol#L385#L411) operation in the bot, it could lead to a denial-of-service (DOS).

And the same with curve 
![alt curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coffiasd/images/main/CRV.png)
`coins[0]` in above [LP](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCA0253A98D16e9C1e3614caFDA19318EE69772D0) is `CRV` [0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52) 

Reward token from [rewardPool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD22c1Dc9baEb5b549401Dd42E6227953cd816776) is also `CRV` [0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52)

## Impact
bot can not invoke `reinvestReward`  due to revert

## Recommendation
ensure `BAL` token is not in the pool
