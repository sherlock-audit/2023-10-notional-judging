# `borrowedCurrencyAmount` gotten from calling `_redeemFromNotional()` in `BaseStrategyVault.redeemFromNotional()` will be inflated because  primary token gotten from executing trades on external exchanges is not transferred back to the vaults from the Trading Module

## Summary
primary tokens gotten from executing trades on external exchanges is not transferred back to the vaults from the Trading Module, this will cause issues in the BaseStrategyVault.redeemFromNotional() function
## Vulnerability Detail
The vaults will use TradingModule.sol to execute trades on Dexes. 

They will sell a certain amount of sellToken for buyToken(primary token). 

The issue is that after the vaults use the TradingModule contract to execute trades on Dexes, the primary tokens(buy Token) gotten from executing trades on external exchanges is not transferred back to the vaults from the Trading Module

Now amount of primary token gotten from executing trades on external exchanges will reflect in `borrowedCurrencyAmount` but it's not really transferred back into the vaults, so `borrowedCurrencyAmount` will always be inflated above the balance of _UNDERLYING_TOKEN that is really in the vault resulting in issues [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/common/BaseStrategyVault.sol#L204)


The main logic of this vulnerability here is that `borrowedCurrencyAmount` will be inflated by the amount of primary token gotten from executing trades on external exchanges but the primary tokens aren't sent back into the vaults.

SO the primary tokens gotten from the executing trades on external exchanges won't reflect in the balance of the `_UNDERLYING_TOKEN`.

## Impact
`borrowedCurrencyAmount` gotten from calling _redeemFromNotional() in BaseStrategyVault.redeemFromNotional() will be inflated because primary token gotten from executing trades on external exchanges is not transferred back to the vaults from the Trading Module

BaseStrategyVault.redeemFromNotional() may always revert because `borrowedCurrencyAmount` will always be inflated above the balance of _UNDERLYING_TOKEN that is really in the vault [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional/blob/main/leveraged-vaults/contracts/vaults/common/BaseStrategyVault.sol#L204)

transferToNotional may always be greater than  balance of _UNDERLYING_TOKEN causing reverts due to insufficient balance

## Recommendation
transfer the primary token gotten from executing trades on external exchanges back into the vaults
